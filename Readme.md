# Add Voucher By Link
==========

Add Voucher By Link is s simple Prestashop Module that allows passing voucher codes through the URL.
It´s as easy to use as adding the parameter 'voucher' anywhere in the URL, in any prestashop page.
The code will have to be previously created.

Once the costumer will open the page, the voucher will be immediately added to the current cart.

Any fix you find or any improvement will be appreciated and added.
